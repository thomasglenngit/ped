        <p class="p1">MUSC 3630 VOCAL PEDAGOGY I FALL 2013</p>
        <p class="p1">Professor Thomas Glenn, MWF 3:00-3:50 ENGR 206</p>
        <p class="p1">Course Description:</p>
        <p class="p1">In this class we will be exploring the facts and fictions surrounding the following topics as they</p>
        <p class="p1">relate to the singing voice: how learning happens, posture &amp; body alignment, breathing &amp; support,</p>
        <p class="p1">phonation (attack/onset), registration, resonance, articulation, and coordination. This class is not</p>
        <p class="p1">intended to indoctrinate you into any one pedagogical approach, but rather to equip you with</p>
        <p class="p1">enough factual information about the science of singing to allow you to formulate your own</p>
        <p class="p1">educated opinions about a variety of techniques.</p>
        <p class="p1">This class meets three days each week. Mondays and Wednesdays will be devoted to discussion of</p>
        <p class="p1">the materials covered in the reading assignments, and Fridays will focus on the practical</p>
        <p class="p1">application of the material presented at the two lectures. Fridays will also often be used to discuss</p>
        <p class="p1">your performance critiques of the performances given at the Tuesday Master Class and the</p>
        <p class="p1">Thursday Voice Recital Hour that week, and to consider how what you are learning might inform</p>
        <p class="p1">both your own study of singing, and affect how you will teach singing.</p>
        <p class="p1">Course Requirements:</p>
        <p class="p1">Most of your assignments will involve postings on the blog for this course. The blog address is:</p>
        <p class="p1">cdvpcb.blogspot.com</p>
        <p class="p1">These assignments will include but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="p1">1. Chapter Summaries for EACH chapter assigned</p>
        <p class="p1">I have posted a sample submission on the blog. You should use the EXACT same formatting</p>
        <p class="p1">for your posts.</p>
        <p class="p1">These include 4 components: Chapter Summary</p>
        <p class="p1">Key Concept</p>
        <p class="p1">Key Terms</p>
        <p class="p1">Making Connections</p>
        <p class="p1">2. Performance Critiques</p>
        <p class="p1">A rubric will be provided for doing a written critique of each singer&rsquo;s performance at the</p>
        <p class="p1">weekly Voice Master Class and Voice Recital Hour. Students in this course are required to</p>
        <p class="p1">attend all Master Classes and Recital Hours.</p>
        <p class="p1">These include the following components: Breathing</p>
        <p class="p1">Intonation</p>
        <p class="p1">Timbre</p>
        <p class="p1">Diction</p>
        <p class="p1">Expressiveness</p>
        <p class="p1">Master Class Improvement</p>
        <p class="p1">Overall Performance</p>
        <p class="p1">3. Lesson Summaries</p>
        <p class="p1">For each of your own voice lessons this semester, you will write a lesson summary and post</p>
        <p class="p1">it to the blog for your classmates to read. I will distribute 4 sample lesson summaries</p>
        <p class="p1">borrowed from the studio of my colleague, Dr. Lynn Helding at Dickinson College.</p>
        <p class="p1">Your summary should include the following components:</p>
        <p class="p1">Lesson Date</p>
        <p class="p1">Statement about your preparedness</p>
        <p class="p1">Summary of activities in lesson</p>
        <p class="p1">Key things you learned</p>
        <p class="p1">Goals for your next lesson</p>
        <p class="p1">List of any new (not listed in previous lesson summary) vocalizes done</p>
        <p class="p1">4. Self-Video assignments</p>
        <p class="p1">Twice in the semester you are to post a video of yourself singing one complete song or aria.</p>
        <p class="p1">Then you are to write a paragraph or two about what you learned from watching this video</p>
        <p class="p1">of yourself. Your report needs to use very specific language. No good, bad, pretty, ugly.</p>
        <p class="p1">Each student is required to view 10 of these video postings and respond with a</p>
        <p class="p1">pedagogically specific and constructive comment about what s/he saw in the video. Speak</p>
        <p class="p1">particularly to those concepts that are aided by being able to see, rather than just hear, the</p>
        <p class="p1">performance.</p>
        <p class="p1">5. Youtube Comparing/Ranking assignments</p>
        <p class="p1">Throughout the semester I will be posting links to youtube videos of performances. Often</p>
        <p class="p1">these assignments will ask you to compare performances of the same piece. For these</p>
        <p class="p1">assignments you will need to rank the performances from best to worst (in your opinion)</p>
        <p class="p1">and then support your rankings with specific comments about the performance. Hint: Use</p>
        <p class="p1">some of the same skills you are learning in your performance critiquing assignments.</p>
        <p class="p1">The required texts for this course are:</p>
        <p class="p1">Coyle, Daniel. The Talent Code: Greatness Isn&rsquo;t Born, It&rsquo;s Grown. Here&rsquo;s How. New York: Bantam</p>

        <p class="p1">actual reading PLUS the Lesson Summaries Posts) are due by 6 pm on the evening before they are</p>
        <p class="p1">to be discussed in class.</p>
        <p class="p1">I reserve the right to make additions and/or adjustments to the reading schedule.</p>
